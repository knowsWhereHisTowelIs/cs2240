Assignment 7, CS 2240, Fall 2015
Web Server 
Due at Final Exam

For this last assignment you will build some minimal web server. The general specifications are:

1) The server can handle multiple clients.

2) The server can manage GET Http requests and serve image and audio files. 

3) The server will attempt to notice multiple requests from the same IP address, implementing a security policy that attempts to defeat some crude DDOS attack. 


The Unix system calls you build with are those that allow a 'socket' to be created for something you might think of as a networked pipe. On top of this flow of data you must implement the simplest HTTP protocol so that GET requests can be managed. 

We will assume that for each client you will spin off a thread that handles the server / client interaction. I don't know if forking processes is any easier, but a threaded server would use fewer system resources, and thus I make the assumption. 

There are utilities that we can use to profile your server. I haven't recalled what we have used previously but I will get that identified so that you can 'profile' your server's performance. Colin tells me that a program called Siege can be used to test the DDOS defenses. 

Have your program ready to demo during the final exam, during which additionally you will be asked to actually write or debug some code 'live' since we have time and reasonable security. 

We have two weeks after break, so there is plenty of time to get assignments tidied up nicely. 

Have a good break.
